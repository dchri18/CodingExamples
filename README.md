# CodingExamples
This repo. is a collection of various simple to advance topics that a developer should know. For me, this is what I reference back to whenever I forget something basic. All examples are in C# as this is my preferred language.
As of now, they are broken into the following categories:
* *Algorithms*
* *Concepts*
* *Design Patterns*
